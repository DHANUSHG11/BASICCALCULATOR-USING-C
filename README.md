THIS IS A C PROGRAM TO CREATE A SIMPLE CALCULATOR PERFORMING BASIC ARTHEMETIC CALCULATION,i.e,addition,subraction,multiplication,division.
THE PROGRAM IS MAINLY BASED ON THE SWITCH STATEMENT WHICH ACCEPTS THE USER ENTERED OPERATOR.
HERE THE USER IS ASKED TO ENTER THE NUMBERS USING SPACE AND A OPERATOR TO PERFORM THE OPERATION.
INPUT INFO:
ONLY 2 INPUT IS ACCEPTED
THE INPUT SHOULD BE NUMBERS
ONLY ONE OPEPERATION IS EXECUTED AT A TIME.
THE 2ND VALUE CANNOT BE ZERO FOR THE DIVISION OPERATION,AS IT RESULTS IN ERROR.
